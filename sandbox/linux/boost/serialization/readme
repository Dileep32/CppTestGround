This folder contains a sample code for demonstrating boost serialization library.

Before running the examples, make sure that the Boost library is installed and all 
necessary libraries are build.
To make use of Boost/Serialization we need to build a boost.

Quick Steps:
$ tar --bzip2 -xf /path/to/boost_1_63_0.tar.bz2
$ cd path/to/boost_1_63_0
$ ./bootstrap.sh --help
$ ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/usr/local/
$ ./b2 install

Once all libraries are built, run the following command to compile and link:
1. sample.cpp - simple example 
$ g++ -I /usr/local/include sample.cpp /usr/local/lib/libboost_serialization.a
This should produce a.out as an executable.
$ ./a.out
It will create a new file named 'arfile' where the serialized data is written.

2. boost_tutorial_ex.cpp - example copied from boost tutorial documentation
$ g++ -I /usr/local/include boost_tutorial_ex.cpp /usr/local/lib/libboost_serialization.a \
    -o boost_tutorial_ex
$ ./boost_tutorial_ex
Here, an archive file named "demofile.txt" is created.
